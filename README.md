# Places App
It's a Flutter App that allows users to take a picture of a place and choose the place's location then it displays all the places the users have taken in a listview



## Main Packages

I used the provider package for state management solution for handling the data of the places. I also used the image_picker package which is a plugin for picking images from the library and taking new pictures with the camera. Furthermore, I used the path and the path_provider so I can store the image of the place inside the storage of the device in a known location. I used the sqlflite package which is SQLite plugin for Flutter so I can store the places inside a database.

I used the location package to get the current location of the device or the user, as this location is the location of the place.
